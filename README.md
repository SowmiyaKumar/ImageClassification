# Colon Cancer Cell Classification - Computational Machine Learning Assignment 2
## Overview
This repository contains the work for Assignment 2 of COSC2793 Computational Machine Learning at RMIT University.
The project focuses on designing and creating an end-to-end machine learning system to classify histopathology images of colon cells.

We aim to build and evaluate multiple machine learning models for two classification tasks:

Task 1: Classify images as cancerous or non-cancerous.

Task 2: Classify images into specific cell types: fibroblast, inflammatory, epithelial, or other.

All investigations, analysis, modeling, and final evaluations are conducted in a reproducible Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) following assignment guidelines.

## Objectives
* Design and implement an end-to-end machine learning pipeline.
* Preprocess histopathology image data for modeling.
* Investigate and compare multiple supervised learning algorithms.
* Evaluate model performance through various metrics.
* Make an ultimate judgment on the best model for deployment based on analysis.
* Conduct an independent evaluation by comparing results with published literature.

## Approach
The project methodology includes:
* Data Preprocessing: Image normalization, data augmentation (if applicable), train-test split.
* Modeling: Training and tuning at least one model for each classification task.
* Performance Evaluation: Using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix.
* Ultimate Judgement: Selecting the best performing model based on thorough analysis and justification.
* Independent Evaluation: Comparing model performance with existing published work on similar datasets.

## Key Deliverables
* Jupyter Notebook: Contains all markdowns, code, analysis, evaluations, and final conclusions.
* Model Comparisons: Evaluation of different ML algorithms for both classification tasks.
* Independent Evaluation: Comparison of model results with relevant research papers (e.g., IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging).
* Clear, well-structured report (under 2000 words excluding appendix).

## Dataset
Source: Modified CRCHistoPhenotypes dataset (provided via Canvas).
